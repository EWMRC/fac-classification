```{r}
amwo_data_reconstructed <- readRDS(here::here("classifier_integrated", "fac_primary_state_delineation.rds")) %>% 
  mutate(standardized_date = mdy(paste0(month(time), "/", day(time), "/2020")))
```

Reclassify based on nesting attempts (use only for graphing) and remove classes that I don't want to graph
```{r}
amwo_data_reconstructed <- amwo_data_reconstructed %>% 
  # mutate(primary_point_state = if_else(nesting_attempt == "Nesting", "Nesting", primary_point_state)) %>% 
  filter(!(primary_point_state %in% c("Unknown- bugged frequent schedule", "Dispersal", "Foray loop", "Migratory (summer)")))
```

Calculate % of points in any given week that belong to each step
```{r}

  mutate(week = week(standardized_date)) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(standardized_date = mean(standardized_date), total = n()) %>% #mean
  ungroup()

  mutate(week = week(standardized_date)) %>% 
  group_by(week, primary_point_state) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(weekly_pt1) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n/total) #%>% 
  # mutate(wday = wday(standardized_date)) %>% 
  # mutate(standardized_date = standardized_date - wday)
