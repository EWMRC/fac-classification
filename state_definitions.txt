Stationary: Recursive movements with steps < 30.2 km that are associated with non-migratory behavior.

Migratory (fall/spring): Directional movements along a latitudinal gradient that bring the bird from the breeding to the wintering range, or visa-versa. Steps can be >, =, or < 30.2 km. Fall migratory movements initiate between Aug 1 and Feb 1, while spring migratory movements initiate between Jan 1 and June 1 (I may be able to tighten up this range a bit).

Migratory (summer): Post-breeding movements initiating before Aug 1 that move a bird from the breeding to the wintering range, precluding further migratory movements in the fall.

Foray loops: Movements that include step lengths > 30.2 km but result in < 30.2 km of net displacement between the first and last point. Can occur in any season, as long as the starting and ending state is stationary.

Dispersal events: Movements that include step lengths > 30.2 km and result in > 30.2 km of net displacement between the first and last point, and do not preclude a fall or spring migration. Can occur in any season, as long as the starting and ending state is stationary.
