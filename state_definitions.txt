Stationary: Recursive movements with steps < 30.2 km related to resource acquisition in a fairly discrete space that are associated with non-migratory behavior.

Migratory: Directional movements along a latitudinal gradient that bring the bird from the breeding to the wintering range, or visa-versa. 

Mid-Atlantic Transitory Movements (MATMs): Foray loops up and down a latitudinal gradient occuring in RI, DE, MD, NJ, and VA in either winter or early spring resulting in minimal net displacement, while utilizing habitat within X m of the Atlantic coast

Summer migrations: Movements initiating between XX/XX and XX/XX that move a bird from the breeding to the wintering range, precluding further migratory movements in the fall

Foray loops: Non-MATMs that include step lengths > 30.2 km but result in < 30.2 km of net displacement between the first and last point, and do not preclude a fall or spring migration. In the summer, dispersal events are initiated between 7/1 and 8/1 (Note: Once incidence from 6/26).

Dispersal events: Non-MATMs that include step lengths > 30.2 km and result in > 30.2 km of net displacement between the first and last point, and do not preclude a fall or spring migration. In the summer, dispersal events are initiated between 7/1 and 8/1.
