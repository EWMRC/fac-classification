# mapping our classification columns -> Movebank attributes

primary_step_state (Migrating/not migrating) -> migration stage custom

primary_point_state (Migrating/not migrating) -> behavioural classification

secondary_step_state (Within-stage ranging movements) -> comments

secondary_point_state (Within-stage ranging movements) -> habitat

nesting -> receiver ID

nocturnal_diurnal -> transmission protocol

flight_ground -> data decoding software

```{r}
amwo_data_reconstructed <- readRDS("classifier_integrated", "fac_primary_state_delineation.rds")

t <- amwo_data_reconstructed %>%
  transmute(event_id = as.character(event_id), primary_step_state = paste("Primary step state:", primary_step_state), primary_point_state = paste("Primary point state:", primary_point_state))

t %>%
