GA-2021-18 orphaned foray loop
MD-2020-15 orphaned foray loop
NC-2020-15 mig spring overwrites the following fall
NC-2020-16 may overwrite the following fall?

Stopping at NC-2020-16. 
Pretty clear that using this technique won't generate mig peaks and phenology
designations that would pass the smell test, and I should probably just use the full model for those graphs

Instead, I'll go through and check LDM designations using the new model

Anticipated results structure:
- Comparative error rates
- Distance/duration/phenology/LDM results using both models
- Migratory peaks using the full model

Checking foray loops to see if they're still valid:
Fall foray loops:
All good

Spring foray loops:
All good

Summer dispersals:
Remove VA-2019-23

Summer foray loops:
Remove MD-2020-15
Remove GA-2021-18

Summer migrations:
All good

Winter dispersals:
All good

Winter foray loops:
Remove ME-2018-08

New foray loops to add:
NY-2018-07-2019 (also added to base model)
RI-2020-44-2021 (also added to base model)
VA-2020-66-2020 (check why it isn't in full model)
