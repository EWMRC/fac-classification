spring_male_3_state_model.rds- looking good, with some april settlements that are potentially questionable
spring_female_3_state_model.rds 
	manually set NC-2022-40-2022 to settled
	probably manually set PA-2021-39-2022 to settled
	VA-2021-98-2022 is not settling correctly; could use interpolated locations
	VA-2022-100-2022 remove 2022-06-26, as it is messing up the designation of the terminal state
	VT-2021-22-2022 is not settling correctly; could use interpolated locations
	VT-2021-25-2022 is going to be a pain in the ass- not enough late locations
	
Use the crawl package to interpolate missing daily locations
