*spring males*
all good = )

General issue: current model forces the last point of 2 into 3
Just going to ignore the difference between 3 and 4.

*spring females*

add to RI problems:
all good = )

SC-2019-03-2019 example of a female that doesn't settle
RI-2019-21 very late fall mig

*Integrated classifier*

**Fixes not to make**
*** CRW causes inferred step of 30.2 km before the first actual 30.2 km step takes place. Hasn't caused major issues (yet) so I'm going to let these be
GA-2020-09 is the first step (2-23-2020) long enough to be migratory?
ME-2017-03 is the first step (10-30-2017) long enough to be migratory?
QUE-2018-04 should settle a point earlier
SC-2021-21 needs to settle one point earlier
VA-2019-18 may settle too early

*** No problems found
VA-2020-69 stationary step potentially >30.2 on 2020-12-01
VT-2020-05 stationary step potentially >30.2
PA-2019-17 stationary too early?
RI-2021-57 potentially late initiation
RI-2019-28 check that settlement occurs on the correct date- seems to be stationary too early
NY-2019-26 does this bird terminate migration by 2019-11-16? Seems like it should stay migratory later
RI-2021-59 put more late points in so it can settle after spring mig. Really interesting track.
Note: wrong ID, was unable to find this
Somewhere in RI-48 through RI-52, there's a late inititation
VT-2020-07 enters stationary very early in spring mig

*** Assorted fixed
NY-2022-40 verified post-breeding migration. Classify as mig starting state
NJ-2018-11 classify as a spring migration. Actually a mortality that was never entered into Movebank.
PA-2019-15 drops out of fall mig too early
RI-2018-11 glitched multi-year track due to a recapture. Set it to settle at the end of its incomplete spring mig to fix this
VA-2019-45 very late migration (continues after 6/30)
VA-2020-52 summer dispersal movement starting on 6-19. Calling it mig for now, may call it disp later
** done NJ-2018-03 should have a winter foray loop on 2019-01-18
** done NY-2018-03 should have a fall foray loop on 2018-10-15
** done SC-2019-03 append additional points to this track so it settles?
** done PA-2018-01 not shifting from stopover to stationary
** done PA-2020-22 fall foray loop on 2020-11-06 (removed outlier manually)
** done RI-2018-15 winter foray loop on 2018-12-10 (gonna let this be, as there's only one point in the stationary area)
** done RI-2020-31 shifts directly from foray loop to migration
** done VA-2019-48 append additional points to this track so it settles?
** done NY-2018-04 winter foray loop on 2018-11-22- not settling, remove foray loop?
** done PA-2019-15 winter foray loop on 2019-12-13- add the foray loop
** done RI-2021-46 spring foray loop on 2022-02-14 prior to migration- doesn't enter stationary before foray loop
** done VA-2021-92 foray loop on 2021-10-06- goes directly from foray loop to migratory

*** spring foray loops
** done RI-2020-31 several MATM
** done Categorize FL-2021-01 however I'd like

*** Capture point RI
** done RI-2021-59 points started getting taken late. At the very least put this into mig for the initial state.
