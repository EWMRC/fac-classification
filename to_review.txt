Spring males:
VT-2021-27-2022 isn't settling, probably because the transmitter died too early

Spring females:
NY-2018-07-2019 has two distinct breeding areas, but correctly marked. I think. Probably controversial.
SC-2019-03-2019 should have been booted into residential. Good candidate to see if the julian day performs better

Fall birds:
NJ-2018-09-2018 doesn't enter residential, largely due to a short migration and a massive winter home range. 
Good candidate to see if the julian day performs better. Adding lat might also help here...

NJ-2018-15-2018 is wrongly classified as a migration- actually a one-way dispersal movement

NY-2018-02-2018 maybe should have settled? Good candidate to see if the julian day performs better


After new data streams:
Spring males
MD-2019-05-2019 isn't settling. Julian day issues? Yay fixed
NC-2019-01-2019 same thing  Yay fixed

FAC:
VA-2018-01 likely settled, but its transmitted died too early for us to tell
RI-2018-01 didn't settle, but it probably should have
Point state doesn't seem to be operating correctly- first point reflects step state
Example: ME-2017-02

ME-2017-02 isn't getting kicked into a terminal state correctly... likely due to extended stopovers along route
Might need to advance to a new version and see if this gets fixed.
ME-2017-03-2017 is problematic due to exploratory movement
