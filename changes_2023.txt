AL-2022-15 allow fall migration to begin as early as 2022-06-15
	Fixed by allowing locations from as early as 2022-06-12 in the delineation for AL-2022-15
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME


NY-2019-11 never settles in fall- why?
	Fall migration initiates on 2019-11-05 20:01:04 and never terminates
	Fall model doesn't push this bird into stationary before locations end on Dec 31, although we know it is because locations pick up again in late Feb. Added a known settling state for the last location in fall.
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME


VA-2020-66 not settling in fall before foray loop on 2021-1-25 through 2021-1-29
	Removed points in foray loop from fall mig designation
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME


VA-2022-100 fall migration doesn't initiate, spring migration never ends
	Spring 2022 migration needs an enddate
	Included an additional month worth of locations to help this bird settle
	RERUN SPRING FEMALE AND CHECK ME

-- Address w/ full group:

SC-2022-25 variable initial state?

SC-2023-26 variable initial state?

VT-2022-30 shortest spring migration to date? or should this be a dispersal movement?

WI-2023-01 first location on 4/16. Needs a variable initial state assignment (probably for all of WI)

WV-2023-20 migrated after capture. set estimable initial state?

WV-2023-23 migrated after capture. set estimable initial state?


-- No edits necessary:
NS-2022-08 actually has a beach location

NS-2022-10 settled really early in spring- why?
