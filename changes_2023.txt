NS-2022-08 actually has a beach location

NS-2022-10 settled really early in spring- why?

QUE-2022-27 doesn't settle in fall, but not the end of the world

QUE-2022-28 doesn't settle in fall, but not the end of the world

QUE-2022-29 doesn't settle in fall, but not the end of the world

NY-2019-36 never settles in fall- understandable, but inconvenient

SC-2022-25 variable initial state?

SC-2023-26 variable initial state?

-- fixed:

NY-2019-11 never settles in fall- why?
	Fall migration initiates on 2019-11-05 20:01:04 and never terminates
	Fall model doesn't push this bird into stationary before locations end on Dec 31, although we know it is because locations pick up again in late Feb. Added a known settling state for the last location in fall.
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME
	APPEARS TO BE FIXED

VA-2020-66 not settling in fall before foray loop on 2021-1-25 through 2021-1-29
	Removed points in foray loop from fall mig designation
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME
	APPEARS TO BE FIXED

VT-2022-30 shortest spring migration to date? or should this be a dispersal movement?
	Dead bird, should be fixed.
	CHECK ME
	FIXED

SC-2022-25 dead bird, should be fixed.
	CHECK ME
	FIXED

Added some code to ensure that NAs don't emerge in the starting state key for all models. 
	CHECK to make sure this worked 
	FIXED

AL-2022-15 allow fall migration to begin as early as 2022-06-15
	Fixed by allowing locations from as early as 2022-06-12 in the delineation for AL-2022-15
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME
	FIXED

WI-2023-01 first location on 4/16. Needs a variable initial state assignment (probably for all of WI)
	Set state to estimable
	RERUN SPRING F AND CHECK ME
	ESTIMATES AS INITIAL STATIONARY- SET TO FIXED MIG
	FIXED

WV-2023-20 migrated after capture. set estimable initial state?
	Set state to estimable
	RERUN SPRING F AND CHECK ME
	ESTIMATES AS INITIAL STATIONARY- SET TO FIXED MIG
	FIXED

VA-2022-100 fall migration doesn't initiate, spring migration never ends
	Spring 2022 migration needs an enddate
	Included an additional month worth of locations to help this bird settle
	RERUN SPRING FEMALE AND CHECK ME
	NOW BEGINS FALL MIGRATION IN JUNE 2022??
	FIXED

All lazarus schedules (fall)
	Won't converge into a final state due to not enough data at migration endpoint, so forcing a post-mig state to all locations after Dec. 15
	RERUN FALL AND CHECK ME
	FIXED

WV-2023-23 migrated after capture. set estimable initial state?
	Set state to estimable
	RERUN SPRING F AND CHECK ME
	ESTIMATES AS INITIAL STATIONARY- SET TO FIXED MIG
	Additionally needed to exempt from r1p1s2 designation
	FIXED

PA-2021-37 goes straight from fall mig to foray loop
  Points in foray loop need to be excluded from the fall HMM designation
  FIXED
